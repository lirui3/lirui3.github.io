I am a PhD candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Monash University, advised by **Dr. Wynita Griggs** and **Dr. [cite_start]Michael Burke**[cite: 15]. [cite_start]My research lies at the intersection of **intelligent transport systems**, **business analytics**, and **human–AI interaction**[cite: 2].

[cite_start]Currently, I am working on my thesis titled *"From perception to interaction: Psychological drivers and adaptive conversational agents for shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs)"*[cite: 17]. [cite_start]My work explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and psychological ownership can regulate user experience in autonomous mobility systems[cite: 20, 21].

[cite_start]Prior to my PhD, I gained experience as a Research Assistant in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering[cite: 28]. [cite_start]I am also passionate about education, currently serving as an **Assistant Lecturer** at Monash University[cite: 38], where I apply AI and analytics to enhance engineering education.

[cite_start]My research has been published in top-tier journals such as *Technological Forecasting & Social Change* (Q1) and *Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering* (Q1)[cite: 22, 27].

### Research Interests

* [cite_start]**Human–AI Interaction & User Experience:** Designing adaptive agents for autonomous systems[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]**Intelligent Transport Systems:** Predictive modelling and real-time analytics in transport behaviour[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**LLM Applications:** Exploring LLMs in engineering education and business environments[cite: 35].
