I am a PhD candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Monash University, supervised by **Dr. Wynita Griggs** and **Dr. Michael Burke**. My research lies at the intersection of **shared autonomous vehicles**, **psychological ownership**, and **human–AI interaction**.

Currently, I am working on my thesis titled _"From perception to interaction: Psychological drivers and adaptive conversational agents for shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs)"_. My work explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and psychological ownership can regulate user experience in autonomous mobility systems.

With a passion for exploring the intersection of transportation, psychology, and emerging technologies, I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of how SAVs can contribute to sustainable mobility in the future. Passionate in researching, teaching, and making positive changes to the world.

### Research Interests

- **Human–AI Interaction & User Experience:** Designing adaptive agents for autonomous systems.
- **Intelligent Transport Systems:** Predictive modelling and real-time analytics in transport behaviour.
- **LLM Applications:** Exploring LLMs in engineering education and business environments.
