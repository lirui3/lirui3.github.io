Monash University offers a **two-day** Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training program for students. The workshop equips participants with practical skills to support peers experiencing a mental health crisis. 

These workshops are **free** for Monash students, with 13 sessions available this year.

Mental health is just as important as physical health. ☀️

> I completed the training in 2023 and found it extremely valuable, not only for improving my understanding of my own mental well-being, but also for learning how to respond appropriately and confidently when others may need support. If you are interested in mental health awareness and peer support, I highly recommend this training.
