Monash University offers a two-day Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training program for students. The workshop equips participants with practical skills and resources to support someone who may be developing a mental health problem or experiencing a mental health crisis until appropriate professional help becomes available.

These workshops are free for Monash students, and there are currently 13 sessions available this year. Register <a href="https://www.monash.edu/students/support/health/mental-health/programs/mental-health-first-aid">here</a> *using your Monash student account*.

I completed the training in 2023 and found it extremely valuable—not only for improving my understanding of my own mental wellbeing, but also for learning how to respond appropriately and confidently when others may need support. If you are interested in mental health awareness and peer support, I highly recommend this training.

Mental health is just as important as physical health. ☀️
