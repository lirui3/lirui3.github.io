Writing a thesis that includes published or accepted journal papers sounds straightforward — until formatting begins.

If you’re preparing a thesis by publication (or a hybrid thesis), you may encounter problems such as:

- Page numbers that don’t match the Table of Contents  
- Blurry figures after copying journal content into Word  
- Word becoming slow or crashing due to large files  
- Inconsistent formatting across chapters  

After testing multiple approaches, I found that the most reliable solution is:

> Prepare the structure in Word, but insert published papers only at the PDF stage.

This guide describes a workflow that produces a clean, submission-ready thesis with consistent page numbering and high-quality journal pages.

## When to Use This Method

This workflow is especially useful if:

- Your thesis includes published or accepted papers  
- You are required to keep the journal layout unchanged  
- You want consistent page numbering across the entire thesis  
- You want to avoid formatting problems close to submission  

---

## Workflow Overview

The process consists of two stages:

Stage 1 – Word
- Create sections
- Set page numbering
- Leave placeholder pages for journal chapters

Stage 2 – PDF
- Export the thesis
- Remove placeholder pages
- Insert journal PDFs
- Add final page numbers

This separation keeps Word stable and ensures the journal pages remain high quality.

---

## Stage 1 – Prepare the Thesis in Word

Assume your thesis text is complete and only formatting remains.

If a chapter is a published paper, insert blank placeholder pages where the paper will later be added.

---

### Step 1. Create Three Sections

Insert Section Breaks (Next Page) at:
- End of the cover page  
- End of the Table of Contents  

You should have:

| Section | Content | Page style |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cover page | No number |
| 2 | Front matter | Roman numerals (i, ii, iii…) |
| 3 | Main chapters | Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3…) |

---

### Step 2. Set Page Numbers

Front matter
- Insert page numbers  
- Format as i, ii, iii…  
- Start at i

Main chapters
- Insert page numbers  
- Format as 1, 2, 3…  
- Start at 1

---

### Step 3. Update the Table of Contents

Update the Table of Contents so all page numbers are correct.

---

### Step 4. Check Page Number Font

Double-click a page number and note:
- Font family  
- Font size  

Tip: Some PDF tools only support even font sizes. Using 10 pt often avoids issues later.

---

### Step 5. Temporarily Remove Main-Chapter Numbers

Before exporting:

1. Go to Chapter 1  
2. Double-click the footer  
3. Turn off “Link to Previous”  
4. Delete the page number  

This removes numbering from all main chapters.

Important:  
Do not update the Table of Contents again after this step.

Export the document as PDF.

---

## Stage 2 – Finalize in a PDF Editor

Open the exported file using a PDF editor (e.g., Adobe Acrobat, PDFgear, or any tool that supports page insertion and numbering).

---

### Step 1. Remove Placeholder Pages

Delete the blank pages that were reserved for the published paper.

---

### Step 2. Insert the Journal PDF

Insert the official journal PDF at the correct position.

This preserves:
- Original layout  
- Fonts and formatting  
- Figure quality  
- Publisher requirements  

---

### Step 3. Add Final Page Numbers

Use the PDF editor’s page numbering feature:

- Style: 1, 2, 3…  
- Start number: 1  
- Apply only to the main chapter range  
- Match the font and size used in Word  

Make sure numbering begins from the page where Chapter 1 actually starts.

Save the final file — your hybrid thesis is now ready.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Updating the Table of Contents after removing page numbers in Word  
- Copy-pasting journal content instead of inserting the official PDF  
- Adding page numbers in both Word and PDF (causes duplication)  
- Forgetting to keep a backup before exporting  

---

## Why This Workflow Works

This approach separates responsibilities:

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| Word | Structure, sections, ToC |
| PDF editor | Final layout and numbering |

Benefits:
- Stable performance in Word  
- High-quality journal pages  
- Consistent page numbering  
- Minimal last-minute formatting stress

## Final Thoughts

Formatting a thesis by publication often becomes unexpectedly time-consuming near submission.  
Setting up a reliable workflow early can save hours of troubleshooting — and a lot of unnecessary stress.

If you're currently in the final stage of your PhD, I hope this guide makes the process a little smoother.
